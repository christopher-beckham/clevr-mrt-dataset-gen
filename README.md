**Under construction**: CLEVR-MRT dataset generation code based off the [CLEVR dataset](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/jcjohns/clevr/).

## Step 1: Generating Images
First we render synthetic images using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), outputting both rendered images as well as a JSON file containing ground-truth scene information for each image.

Blender ships with its own installation of Python which is used to execute scripts that interact with Blender; you'll need to add the `image_generation` directory to Python path of Blender's bundled Python. The easiest way to do this is by adding a `.pth` file to the `site-packages` directory of Blender's Python, like this:

```bash
echo $PWD/image_generation >> $BLENDER/$VERSION/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

where `$BLENDER` is the directory where Blender is installed and `$VERSION` is your Blender version; for example on OSX you might run:

```bash
echo $PWD/image_generation >> /Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/Resources/2.78/python/lib/python3.5/site-packages/clevr.pth
```

You can then render some images like this:

```bash
cd image_generation
blender --background --python render_images.py -- --num_images 10
```

On OSX the `blender` binary is located inside the blender.app directory; for convenience you may want to
add the following alias to your `~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
alias blender='/Applications/blender/blender.app/Contents/MacOS/blender'
```

If you have an NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed then you can use the GPU to accelerate rendering like this:

```bash
blender --background --python render_images.py -- --num_images 10 --use_gpu 1
```

After this command terminates you should have ten freshly rendered images stored in `output/images` like these:

<div align="center">
  <img src="images/img1.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img2.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img3.png" width="260px">
  <br>
  <img src="images/img4.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img5.png" width="260px">
  <img src="images/img6.png" width="260px">
</div>

The file `output/CLEVR_scenes.json` will contain ground-truth scene information for all newly rendered images.

You can find [more details about image rendering here](image_generation/README.md).

## Step 2: Generating Questions
Next we generate questions, functional programs, and answers for the rendered images generated in the previous step.
This step takes as input the single JSON file containing all ground-truth scene information, and outputs a JSON file 
containing questions, answers, and functional programs for the questions in a single JSON file.

You can generate questions like this:

```bash
cd question_generation
python generate_questions.py
```

The file `output/CLEVR_questions.json` will then contain questions for the generated images.

You can [find more details about question generation here](question_generation/README.md).
